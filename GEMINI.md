# Refactor: Profile Page with Supabase

## Goal
- Use Supabase for authentication.  
- Redirect users to `/polls` after successful sign-up or login.  
- Keep all other parts of the project unchanged.  

## Constraints
- Next.js + Supabase only.  
- No custom JWT or localStorage handling.  
 

## Notes
- Refactor only `app/profile/page.tsx` (or equivalent file).  
- Ensure redirect after auth success.  
- Leave existing project structure intact.
